    <h5>Comfort sauce.</h5>

    <H3>Ingredients</H3>
    <uo>
        <li>Optional: Spaghetti Noodles</li>
        <li>Essential, non-negotiable: Classico Red Pepper Sauce. Seriously, if you don't have this sauce, go back to the store and buy it. Buy all of them.</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
    </uo>

    <H3>Steps</H3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water and add dry spaghetti noodles. Or don't make spaghetti at all, because the only reason we're making this dish is for mom's spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li>On low, simmer several cloves of garlic and chili powder. Don't do this while mom is around unless you want to be told about how you're doing it wrong. Better yet, have mom do it.</li>
        <li>Watch Netflix for a while and then add the sauce.</li>
        <li>Watch another two Netflix shows until the sauce is simmering and looks like it did when you put it in the pot.</li>
        <li>Eat with a spoon or toasted garlic bread.</li>
    </ol>
